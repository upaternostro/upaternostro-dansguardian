# Managed by puppet, do not edit!
#Content modifying Regular Expressions
#
# The format is: "extended regular expression"->"replacement straight string"
# E.g. "shit"->"censored" would replace all occurances of shit in any case.
# Far more complicated matches are possible.  See other sources for examples
# of extended regular expressions.

# These are just some examples.  If you write any, for example, to
# remove popups etc, please send them to author at dansguardian.org.
#
#"<script language.*open\(.*script>"->"<!-- its gone -->"
#"fuck|cunt|shit"->"**censored**"
#
# For ALL of these to work it requires dansguardian to be built with PCRE support,
# but some may work with the default C library regular expression support.
#
# Some of these are based on regular expressions from Privoxy.
